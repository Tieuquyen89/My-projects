Hello everyone,
Personally, I received some concerns regarding Data Job Market currently in Vietnam from graduates about "What is the tendency right now? What are the skills & requirements for graduates/ job seekers to get the necessary information for their preparation to cope with the current job market?". Besides, it is also my concern whom is persuading Business Analytics career path. That is the reason I did the 1st project of VNM Job Market EDA & System Recommendation for your reading/information the current labor market in VN with the process as follows:

1. Web scrawling data using the package of Beatiful Soup
2. Data preprocessing 
3. EDA & Text analyst
4. System recommendation using K-Mean algorithms 

Pls feel free to read my personal projects & the insight into the current job market information (Mar 2021) & share your comments if any

Many thanks
